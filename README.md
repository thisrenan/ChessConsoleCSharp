# Statement:

Chess is a two-player sport that can be classified as a strategic board game, both recreational and competitive. The current form of the game emerged in southwestern Europe in the second half of the 15th century, during the Renaissance, after being developed from its ancient origins. Chess belongs to a family of games and today, according to chess historians, all of them originated from the game Chaturanga, which was played in India in the 6th century.

A game of chess is played on a board with alternating light and dark squares, and at the beginning, each player controls sixteen pieces with different shapes and characteristics. The objective of the game is to knock down the opponent's king, the final move called "checkmate".
